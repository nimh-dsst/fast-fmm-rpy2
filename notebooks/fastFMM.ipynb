    "`fastFMM` is a toolkit for fitting functional mixed models (FMMs) and implements the fast univariate inference (FUI) method proposed in [Cui et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2021.1950006) and further described in [Loewinger et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.95802.2) and Xin et al. (2025). In this vignette, we provide a tutorial on how to use the `fui` function to fit non-concurrent and concurrent FMMs. "

Let $i = 1, 2, ..., I$ be the index of the subject and $j = 1, 2, ..., J_i$ be the index of longitudinal visit at time $t_{i, j}$. For each visit of each subject, we observe the fixed effects column vector $\\mathbf{X}_{i, j} = [X_{i, j, 1}, X_{i, j, 2}, \\dots, X_{i, j, p}]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ and the random effects column vector $\\mathbf{Z}_{ij} = [Z_{i, j, 1}, Z_{i, j, 2}, ..., Z_{i, j, q}]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^q$. Let $g(\\cdot)$ be some pre-specified link function and $EF(\\cdot)$ be some exponential family distribution. A longitudinal function-on-scalar regression model has the form\n",

    "referred to as a functional mixed model (FMM) in the functional data analysis (FDA) literature. Many statistical methods have been proposed to fit FMMs, and generally fall into two categories: joint methods and marginal methods. FUI is a marginal method that is computationally fast and achieves similar estimation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art joint method, such as the `refund::pffr()` function.\n",

Let $\\boldsymbol{\\tilde{\\beta}}(s_1), \\boldsymbol{\\tilde{\\beta}}(s_2), ..., \\boldsymbol{\\tilde{\\beta}}(s_L)$ be the estimates of fixed effects from $L$ separate univariate GLMMs.\n",

Using penalized splines, aggregate and smooth the coefficient estimates $\\boldsymbol{\\tilde{\\beta}}(s_1), \\boldsymbol{\\tilde{\\beta}}(s_2), ..., \\boldsymbol{\\tilde{\\beta}}(s_L)$ to produce estimates $\\{\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}}(s), s \\in \\mathcal{S}\\}$. \n",
    "3. *Build pointwise and joint confidence intervals*. Combine the within-timepoint variance and the between-timepoint covariance to create confidence bands around the smoothed estimates from Step 2. For Gaussian data, we can obtain these estimates analytically. For other distributions, we implement cluster bootstrap. \n",

    "FUI decomposes the complex correlation structure into longitudinal and functional directions, allowing for a computationally efficient estimation procedure. [Cui et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2021.1950006) contains additional details on the theoretical derivation of the analytic and bootstrap approach to model fitting. We also extend the analytic approach to general random effects specifications in [Loewinger et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.95802.2) and concurrent model fitting in Xin et al. (2025)."
